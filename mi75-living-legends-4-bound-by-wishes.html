                            <p># The Reforms When the lands on the horn were taken by the Admiral who would soon become the Garad, he made numerous reforms in the society and structure of the Empire he seized and named Zoqaa. After consuming the power of Sukutra and transforming himself into Abu a-Dunya come to earth in the eyes of the populace, he had temples built around in the lands he controlled, aided by the Merchant Lords of Punt. These temples informed the people of the Garad's power, and assured them of the glory. #PREFACE FAIR WARNING: this is going to be an incredibly long post. It is a 28-page essay examining Tony Stark's journey from Iron Man to Endgame  It is a literal wall of text, so proceed with caution (: Greetings, fellow Marvel fans! Ever since I wrote my essay on Thanos (https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/8gtlin/thanos_the_messianic_hero_an_academic_exposition/) after the release of Avengers: Infinity War , I have been contemplating a series of academic essays on diffe. Inspired by This post (https://www.reddit.com/r/danganronpa/comments/b8ivs4/hercules_au/) Makoto Naegi; God of Hope Leader of the Pantheon. Makoto is the god who unites the people of the world to their goals. Once, the world was ruled over by the Cruel Goddess Junko, driving people to live cruel and short lived lives. Together with other gods, he overthrew her and cast her down to hell. He is known to be kind hearted, which is why he has earned the adoration of the mortal world. There. # Introduction Strahd has many minions in Barovia: sycophantic nobles, savage werewolves, and vampiric thralls. But few hold higher esteem in Strahd's eyes than his three brides: Ludmilla, Volenta, and Anastraya. These consorts are among Strahd's most valued possessions and serve as an entertaining distraction between the reincarnations of his one true fixation, Tatyana. However, after a reading from the illustrious Madame Eva, Strahd has discovered that own of his beloved brides is secretly. This is probably easier to read/more nicely formatted on my blog, HERE (https://asongoficeandtootles.wordpress.com/2019/04/01/olenna2). This is part 2 of Chapter 7 in my Secret History of House Martell , which I divided in half for purely logistical reasons. It is a straight continuation of Part 1, which you can find HERE (https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/b83otz/the_dragon_and_the_thorns_the_secret_history_of/). ##Serra's Younger Years What was done with Serra? ###The Faith. f :https://redd.it/7zkier p :https://redd.it/b7rdec d :https://discord.gg/28uMqQs n :https://redd.it/biv9vf Close to my intended post date, I promise to post on Thursday next time. For now, here's a new chapter. Enjoy. Discord d First f Previous p Next n Dexter We ended up using the Teleport spell to get up to the doorway again and started walking back manually. I stretched my tired muscles as our footsteps echoed around the tunnel. My muscles had initially. Day of the Daedra It was evening when we walked silently through the streets of Vivec; Nevelion, Aqua-Lung, and I. Aqua-Lung clung to my arm with one hand, cradling her swollen belly in the other. Nevelion’s eyes were wide and unblinking, only a slight tremor betraying his frayed nerves. I was taking several swigs from my flask at regular intervals. The alcohol had the wonderful effect of numbing me to what we had just witnessed early this morning. The better part of the day had been spent. 
So we're back. Another Review Megathread for another DC Universe show. People like Doom Patrol even more than Titans! TheGWW.com (https://thegww.com/doom-patrol-episode-one-review/) gtThe first episode of Doom Patrol is easily one of the greatest pieces of comic book television ever made. The writing is nothing short of stellar and the cast deliver excellent performances, specifically Diane Guerrero (Crazy Jane) and Brendan Fraser (Robotman). gtThe show also excels Of all the races of the land dwelling vastaya, none were as advanced and as intelligent as the Vul'pah, a confederation of twenty different tribes of fox vastaya. The Vul'pah was a flourishing civilization that once resided at the Northern parts of Ionia, but after the subsequent Noxian invasion of Ionia, they disappeared. To preserve what was left among the tribes, they decided to move and live in a certain paradise free from Runeterra's clutches, where they could finally start over. What Patron ideas do y'all have that go beyond the Celestial, Old One, Demon, and Fae from the PHB/core books? These first few are from comments on some facebook posts I got this inspiration from. (It's a private group so I won't list any names, but credit goes to those brilliant people.) amp#x200B; d100 Warlock Patron Contributor :- :- :- 1 An ancient dragon \-private- 2 A powerful lich \-private- 3 A djinn \-private- 4 An aboleth \-private- 5 Their patron is secretly their. It was a rather strange crowd in the foyer: four men—one young, three middle-aged—sat pondering the situation. Other than a clear sense of weariness graying their otherwise kind faces, there was nothing outstanding about their appearance. Well, one of them did seem off: his skin was way too smooth, his eyes glazed over like marbles or dolls' eyes. He was also the only one untouched by exhaustion, his face emotionless and cold like the glazed terracotta warrior that stood watch on a nearby pedest. I have seen this really cool idea of a Harry Potter-esque Jedi Academy series floating around here, and though it's hardly any original idea of mine, I thought about how great things could have been, without exhausting the franchise's image and the public's goodwill, something LucasFilm managed to do for years with the Expanded Universe after the PT finished, before being bought by Disney. I spent a lot of time planning and mapping this out in written form, so please at least 
The Dreaming City is a truly beautiful location and certainly one of the most mysterious places Guardians have ever set foot. But what is it? There is a ton of lore on these topics, and I hope to collate it all here for your perusal and discussion. This post will be mostly cataloguing canon Lore and dialogue, with a bit of theory and speculation. There are tangential topics here which we have very little information on, such as the Ancients, the Aphelion and the Harbingers. I will reference. Lots of gently used and new items looking for a good home! I'm getting married and would prefer the cash to go toward my wedding! Please ask if you're unsure about usage. I try to list usage for everything, including new items. Items are in order of verification photos in each section. Minimum  purchase please. Shipping will be - depending on the number/weight of the items you're interested in. I will ship internationally - please let me know your address so I can get an estimate. Primar. Time for one more short story ! As usual, you can refer to the short stories masterpost (https://www.reddit.com/r/araragi/comments/5eilqt/monogatari_short_stories_translation_project/) for all the information about them. Today's story is Mayoi Ghost (translated by /u/nyorem ), published in the special edition of the Bakemonogatari manga volume 4. As often, it's written from Araragi's point of view, and apparently takes place shortly after Mayoi Maimai. ampnbsp; ampnbsp;. A fun little thread I think everyone can join in on. Basically, throw in a little scene or hook that can be used in-universe to show how massively the world has changed all around them while keeping the street level of things. EDITED IN 51-70 more because I felt inspired 1. The Beckoning starts to afflict only the Methuselah level characters in the setting and certain other elders, leaving power vacuums. The oldest describe it as "hearing the drums of war" then forget they even mentioned. Imagine a world where Chris Jericho was never AEW bound, having lost his IWGP Intercontinental Championship at WrestleKingdom. As he nears his 50s, he looks to go home and finally hang up his boots. amp#x200B; Royal Rumble: Chris Jericho enters the Royal Rumble at (#2) but is eliminated by Shawn Michaels (#29) The main event of the highly anticipated Big 4 event is the Men’s Royal Rumble match. The match is opened up by one of the biggest future stars, Andrade, entering at #1. Zelina. Hello all, and welcome back to the Final Fantasy Brave Exvius Lore Tour with me your host, YinToYang as we have Iggy here driving us around in the Regalia. Today's subject will be The Espers of Lapis! As always I’d like to provide a disclaimer to our audience that the majority of the Topic of Discussion will come from my knowledge of the current state of the Global Release at the time of posting. Therefore, this topic assumes that you the viewer have completed up to the current chapter 
Part 1 (https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/8l30ra/oc_legend_series_part_1/) Part 62 (https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/9o36bu/oc_legend_this_is_exactly_why_i_call_him_an_idiot/) I was really tempted to draw this opening scene out and make it a comic page, and I did manage to make a topographic map of the area with the bandit camp, trail, and Alshwan, Hon'oka, and Nualas' position relevant to the camp, as well as the valley, snowy mountain, and hill, but working on drawing the other. Welcome to the 74th Lets Build ! TOPIC: Thing Demons/Devils Ask For In Their Contracts Die Roll Result :-- :-- 1 Use of your voice for a day. Your voice (which is from someone true and pure of heart) is used to chant a ritual with thousands of other borrowed voices to do something very evil. The evil ritual tainted your voice and now lawful beings have taken notice of the rituals completion and don’t really care for the defence that you weren’t there, your voice was the one chanting. # Chapter 30 First (https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/6oqstg/oc_the_magineer_chapter_1/) Previous (https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/84kyvx/the_magineer_chapter_29/) Patreon (https://www.patreon.com/voodooattack?)

Welcome to Hell! The last major faction will be discussed here and will follow a similar format to the Chaos Dwarf (https://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/7x0dba/chaos_dwarf_speculation_and_roster/) and Ogre Kingdoms (https://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/86t8jc/ogre_kingdoms_speculation_and_roster/) Speculation and Roster. Now, I will be discussing the Daemons of Chaos as one faction as they were on the 8th Edition tabletop (like all other factions) instead of the 4 Chaos God rumour. Ok I am starting off assuming that you will read this lore entry in its entirety, it's not long, but I will summarize. This is the full text of a Ghost Story Lore entry called " Whether Windmills or Cranes (https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/whether-windmills-or-cranes)" which describes a series of "adventures" from the point of view of a Ghost named Panza (a la Don Quijote). It parallels the classic tale pretty closely with the expected Destiny twist on the setting. But what grabbed. It begins. Just as foretold in the match announcement post (https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/9gppng/jojos_oc_tournament_3_round_5_soul_rebels_part_%E2%91%A1/), the mechanically unusual Round 5 has begun. Effectively, to reiterate, this will be a series of four boss matches consisting of duos within the eight-person Soul Rebels team. Their regular teammates may not assist in strategizing this round, but at the same time, should they feel so inclined to vote against their. </p>
